# Neural Network Optimizer Comparison

This notebook compares the performance of different optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adam, Nesterov) on a simple neural network using a pre-generated dataset.

📌 **Note:**  
The dataset was prepared in a previous group task. This notebook focuses solely on training and analyzing the impact of various optimizers.
